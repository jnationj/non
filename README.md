## 🧩 **Slide 2 — The Problem**

**Headline:**

> “Land is Africa’s most valuable asset — but least trusted.”

**Content (2-column layout):**
Left side — bullet pain points:

* 90% of rural land unregistered (World Bank 2024)
* Paper registries → corruption, duplication, and loss
* No digital proof → no access to credit
* Banks can’t verify land titles = capital locked

Right side — graphic:

* “Paper-based Land Registry” → “Corruption → Disputes → Poverty”

---

## 🌐 **Slide 3 — The Solution (The Hook)**

**Headline:**

> Turning land into digital trust.

**Visual Mockup Flow (centered diagram):**
`Upload Land Data → Mint NFT → Request Verification → Get Verified → Access Loans`

**Content:**

* LandNFT.sol → Tokenizes land as NFTs (HTS)
* LandVerifier.sol → Enables government verifiers to approve
* LandLending.sol → Provides loan liquidity via DeFi pools
